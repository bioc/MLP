Description: Pathway analysis based on p-values associated 
  to genes from a genes expression analysis of interest.
  Utility functions enable to extract pathways from the
  Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP), Molecular Function
  (GOMF) and Cellular Component (GOCC), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes of
  Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome databases.
  Methodology, and helper functions to display the results
  as a table, barplot of pathway significance, Gene Ontology
  graph and pathway significance are available.
